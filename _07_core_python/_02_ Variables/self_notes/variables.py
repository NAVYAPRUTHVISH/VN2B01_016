# variables are used to store the values
# in variables we are going to use equal to is used for assigning values for in right side for lift indication
# variables will start with lower case letters
# and also variables can be used _
# we should not start variables with numbers
#eg
x=10
# here we are asign the value for x
print(x)
# here we are print the value of x
# we getting output as 10
#NOW WE ARE GOING TO LEARN ID GIVEN FOR THE VALUES
x=30
#here we are asigned value for x ,now we are going to find id for 30
print(id(x))
# here we getting id of 30 is 1885536912528
# VARIABLES CONTAINS OPERATORS
# THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF OPERATORS
# 1. WRITE OPERATOR ,2. READ OPERATORS
# WRITE  OPERATOR IS USED TO CONVERT THE VALUES IN BINARY FORMAT
# READ OPERATORS USED TO READ THE VALUES OF NUMBER IN{INT,FLOAT,LONG,COMPLEX}
# IN BOOLEAN WE ARE GOING TO ASIGN{ TRUE,FLASE}
x=True
# here we are asigning the true value for x
print(x)
# here output is true
# in above example X IS A LHS;TRUE IS A RHS
# IN PYTHON LHS WILL START EXCEUTE FIRST(X IS A VARIABLE) AND RHS IS USED TO GIVE VALUES(RHS IS USED TO GIVE THE VALUES)
 #IN PYTHON ONE BYTE =8 BITS
 # 1024 bytes - 1KB
 #1024 KB    - 1MB
 #1024 MB    - 1GB
 # VARIABLES IS AMEMORY LOCATION OF  VALUES
 # IDENTIFIERS ARE USED TO HOLD THE VALUES
 # HERE WE ARE NOT GOING TO SPECFY  ANY TYPE OF VARIABLES LIKE INT, FLOAT,BLOOLEAN
 # PYTHON IS SMART TO IDENTIFY THE VALUES
 # in python we used to asign the values to variable ,it automatically generates the variables
miles=2.5
launch=20
name="navya"
print(-miles)
print(-launch)
print(name)
# output is -2.5,-20;navya
x=y=z=10
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
'''
one values we can asign in different variables
but for one variable we cannot asign different values
it takes only last value assigned ,we xcan seen above example
'''
x=y=z='fruit'
print(x[1])
print(y[3])
# for string values we take to write values in double cotations
x=10
x=20
x=30
print(x)
'''
oin above example we are assigning one variable different variables but it takeslast value result only
